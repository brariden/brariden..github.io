**Who is this guy?**
I’m an IT consultant working mainly in Solution Architecture, husband, father of five, and genuinely interested in everything.  As a kid I slept with a Tandy 2000 about three feet from my head so computer science is close to my heart.  Or at least the radiation was close to my brain.  I like to rotate hobbies every month or so to keep life interesting.  Will I make a plywood boat this month or start raising pigs?  

**What is this blog?**
This blog is just my way of practicing writing and recording my thoughts before I forget them. There is no real reason or theme as of yet. Maybe my kids will find this when they’re older and laugh at me.
